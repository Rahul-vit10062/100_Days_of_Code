Question:-
            Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
            Return the sum of the three integers.
            You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
Test Case 1:-
            Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
            Output: 2
Explanation: 
            The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

Example 2:
            Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
            Output: 0
Explanation: 
            The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
Constraints:
            3 <= nums.length <= 500
            -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
            -104 <= target <= 104
            
Logics:-
          class Solution {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
             Arrays.sort(nums);
        int diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int left = i + 1;
            int right = nums.length - 1;
            
            while (left < right) {
                int sum  = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
                
                if (Math.abs(target - sum) < Math.abs(diff)) {
                    diff = target - sum;
                }
                
                if (sum > target) {
                    right--;
                }
                else {
                    left++;
                }
            }
        }
        return (target-diff);
    }
}
